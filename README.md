## List of Technologies
### Which tools fit best for your project?

**Data Sources:** wakecountyhousing.csv

**Software:**  pgAdmin 4, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, Python matpotlib, Juyter notebook, Pandas, Excel.

**Database:** PostgreSQL 11, AWS for data storage.

**Data Cleaning and Transformation libraries** NumPy, Pandas. Matplotlib.

**Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn is the library used to perform data classification and Logistic Regression.

**Dashboard** Leaflet Mapping API and geoapify for coding, Tableau??

**Source Control** all code repository and readme files are stored in Github.

### Which tools will you use for each section?
- Cleaning the data: We used Pandas library to clean data. This was done by
     a** creating dataFrames to select columns needed for analysis 
     b** using isnul().sum() to retrieve total number of null for each column and eliminate rows as necessary.
     c** describe() funciton is used to get averages and other stats to ensure data validation.
     d** using dtype function to check and convert object and number fields.

- Data Storage: PostgreSQL and AWS to store data and extract csv files for analysis.
- Database Design: Quick DBD was used to create ER diagram for daatase table design.

## Current Status
### Specific Needs
- Segment 1: <br />
Cleaning the two potential data sets <br />
Creating a provisional machine learning model

### Exisiting Challenges
- Segment 1: <br />
Finding a big enough database that contains all of the desired information we need to feed into our machine learning model.<br />
Testing to see if we create a webpage that allows us to enter inputs and show us a response from our trained machine learning model.
